        Async fault tolerant ML framework for workload balancing
      </h1>
      <h2 class="subtitle">Project proposal by Michael Bausano</h2>
    </header>

    <section>
      <h3>Motivation</h3>
      <p>
        I propose a framework for processing large datasets used to train
        machine learning functions or form knowledge databases. Its asynchronous
        architecture is well scalable on both axes in all subparts.
        To illustrate different points, two use cases are presented along with
        this framework. Each subsystem described then has an abstract definition
        and a short example of how it applies to both use cases.
      </p>

      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        This framework gives machine learning experts a tool to quickly
        bootstrap their environment. They can focus on working on the data
        rather than fault tolerance and concurrency of their system, while still
        being in control of the flow. This framework consists of an AWS Cloud
        Formation script that creates the stack and uploads the codebase. It has
        a master that overlooks the whole system and workers in different
        factories that report to master. It has two major storage units. One
        checks and indexes the input data based on model requirements. The
        second one is the resulting knowledge base or trained function. This
        framework supports multiple types of storage units, such as graph
        databases, relational databases, or S3. Most of the features (such as
        the first storage unit) are optional and the FW user can implement them
        if they feel it fits their use case.
      </p>

      <h3>Use cases</h3>
      <p>
        Following use cases will be described at each stage to illuminate how
        the framework works:
      </p>

      <i>User's track playlist analysis</i>
      <p>
        By analyzing the listening habits of a user, we can offer great
        suggestions of songs they have not heard yet but will most likely enjoy.
        We can do this by using APIs of streaming services such as Spotify to
        gather data. Then we build graphs from these songs.
      </p>

      <i>Labelling a song's genre</i>
      <p>
        Using Spotify APIs, we can analyse the different musical properties of
        each song. Each song comes labelled. We can use this to train a neural
        network to guess a song's genre.
      </p>

      <h3>Master</h3>
      <p>
        Master has two modules. The first one scales each section depending on
        the needs to ensure there are no resources wasted or lacking. It looks
        for issues in each section by analyzing how often each instance outputs,
        how much dead letter queue waste it produces, etc. It crafts reports
        that are sent to the FW user.
      </p>

      <p>
        The second module synchronizes merging the data to the master database,
        which should be done in larger chunks.
      </p>

      <h3>Factories</h3>
      <p>
        Factories are clusters of workers with the same purpose which poll the
        input queue and push their output to an output queue that is controlled
        by the master.
      </p>

      <h3>Flow</h3>
      <p>
        The flow starts with an SQS to which data preprocessing crawlers push
        data. The SQS optionally linked to gatekeeper workers. These scripts can
        have several use cases such as validating the data, discarding duplicates,
        and routing the data to a correct processing instance. Routing the data
        could be used in a way that there's only one input into the stack which
        trains many different models at once. At this point, the FW user
        provides us with a single gatekeeper script for each stage (0-n stages)
        and the FW makes sure the workers are properly scaled based on the load.
      </p>

      <p>
        The processing instances will work on received data and then commit them.
        In our graph example, it is not necessary to have a copy of the master
        database at this point. However for many machine learning algorithms,
        one wants to have the latest weights and train the function with those
        weights set as initial. Therefore the processing instance may request a
        replica of the master database.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once the data is processed or it receives a sync command from the master,
        every relevant worker commits the results to the last stage, where the
        results from each processing instance are merged with together and with
        the master database. Then it, optionally, goes through a fitness test
        and is committed as the new head of the master data. This new head is
        updated in all relevant processing instances.
      </p>

      <h3>Requirements</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Adapters for popular cloud services
        </li>
        <li>
          Fault tolerance based on queues and master oracle
        </li>
        <li>
          Broad and well-documented settings that is changeable without downtime
        </li>
        <li>
          Support of several popular programming languages for each script (Gatekeeper, processing instance and merger)
        </li>
        <li>
          Admin panel with reports and controls
        </li>
        <li>
          Updates of the master script without downtime
        </li>
        <li>
          SQS (and its relevant alternatives on other cloud platforms) should be replaceable by a service that can enqueue big amount of data (maybe use SQS only as a pointer and upload the data into S3, which brings some possible concurrency races that have to be taken care of)
        </li>
        <li>
          Easy deployment
        </li>
        <li>
          Fitness tests before committing changes to master database
        </li>
        <li>
          Versioning of the master database
        </li>
        <li>
          Optimized for cost-efficiency
        </li>
      </ol>
