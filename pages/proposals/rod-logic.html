        Electromechanical computer with rod logic

    <section>
      <h3>Motivation</h3>
      <p>
        I have read [1] on HackerNews portal which led me to Eric Drexler's [2].
        While I lack the background to validate the first part of E. Drexler's
        thesis where he draws how could an electromechanical machine using rod
        logic be built on a nanoscale, I became very interested in chapter 11.
        Nanomechanical computational systems. Besides drawing plans for
        different rod logic circuits, I have also designed a simple compact rod
        logic housing prototype in dimensions of 20cm x 20cm x 15cm. It has 11
        levels and accommodates up to 34 rods per level. These numbers were
        initially chosen to build a 6-bit adder.
      </p>

      <h3>Gates and circuits</h3>
      <p>
        I am interested in how could logic gates and circuits be positioned with
        respect to their inputs and outputs. I would like to develop a syntax
        for expressing these nuances and explore how could 3rd dimension save on
        space or increase fan-out of a gate or circuit.
      </p>

      <p>
        Forming an instruction set and then explaining how could it be
        implemented and what processes could be borrowed by analogy from
        electrical CPUs is essential should I try to build a universal machine.
      </p>

      <h3>Clocking</h3>
      <p>
        The idea of a driver on one end with a spring on the other simplifies
        the issue of rod synchronization. I hope to define assumptions that
        can be made based on this design such as when is it desirable to reset
        rods in parallel, in what order should the rods be pushed and released,
        how does a structure error propagate through the model and so on.
      </p>

      <p>
        I would also concentrate on clocked oscillators and their possible use
        for collecting outputs and storing them into registers.
      </p>

      <h3>Turing machine</h3>
      <p>
        Besides goals touched above, I strive to redesign my prototype based on
        my research and scale it down from centimeters to millimeters. Once I
        had models in smaller dimensions, I could implement the instruction set
        I would have proposed. If I succeeded with these experiments, ultimately
        I would aim to implement the abstraction of a programmable Turing
        a-machine described in [3].
