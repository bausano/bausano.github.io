      <h3>Motivation</h3>
      <p>
        I hope to understand how certain dataset features and output constraints
        affect the performance of popular natural language processing algorithms.
        Furthermore, I would like to develop a set of optimizations and formalize
        the connection between each and the dataset features.
      </p>

      <h3>Dataset</h3>
      <p>
        I have been given access to a large database of man written sentences.
        Each sentence is linked to several others of the same meaning. This
        dataset includes multiple languages such as German, English, Spanish
        and French.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are several key features of the dataset. For example,
        the sentences all belong to the same or very similar domain. There are
        metadata about each sentence that identifies key substrings.
        One can often link synonyms across languages.
      </p>

      <h3>Goal</h3>
      <p>
        I start by analyzing the features of the dataset and formalize them in
        such a manner that they can be re-identified in other datasets. The
        results will then be applicable to other use cases.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then I define expected outcomes. Most importantly, the program should
        yield synonyms to a sentence the program haven't seen before. Majority
        of the sentences should be indistinguishable with human written ones.
        Linking a new sentence to a list of existing synonyms in the dataset is
        crucial for expanding our dataset artificially.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once the clear input and expected output is defined, I develop sets of
        algorithms and optimizations and link them to a dataset feature that
        allows for a particular method to work.
